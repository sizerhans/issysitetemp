Isabella Tessier is an artist who works between Newcastle and London. Her art practice centres around the methodologies used to research, record and capture the transient experience of performance. The physicality of movement and identity of the performance are translated, through drawing, from the artist’s sketchbook and restaged on a larger than human scale. Past projects include collaborative work with theatre companies in Newcastle (2022), making monoprints in response to dance performances in the 59th Venice Biennale during my British Council fellowship (2022) and exploring footage of dance from the Library of Congress’s digital archive, work exhibited in Karina/Rita (2021).
